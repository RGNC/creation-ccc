# creation-ccc
Software for simulating polarizationless P systems with symport/antiport rules and creation rules

The files contain specific functions for solving QSAT with P systems from $\widehat{CCC}(1)$.

In the main file, the formula to be solved can be changed by changing the $formula$ variable, letting it be a formula from the _examples_ file or a custom formula.
